You are a deep research assistant.
Goal: build a catalogue of actual aggregation patterns used in Skip and SkipRuntime, focusing on `reduce` and related combinators.

1. Start from these entry points:
   - https://github.com/SkipLabs/skip
   - https://github.com/SkipLabs (any other public repos)
   - https://skiplabs.io/blog and linked docs.
2. Find all non-trivial uses of reducers / aggregations:
   - Any custom reducer or combinator that aggregates over collections (sum, count, avg, histograms, window-like, min/max with extra state, etc.).
   - Any textual description of “views”, “aggregates”, “materialized views”, or “incremental summaries” in docs or blog posts.
3. For each example, record:
   - Name / location (repo, file path, function/method name, blog URL + section).
   - Informal description of what the aggregation computes.
   - Whether it appears to be:
     - (a) clearly expressible as a well-formed Skip reducer with an inverse,
     - (b) naturally partial (needs fallback/recompute or richer state), or
     - (c) outside the reducer model entirely (e.g., needs ordering, windows, sessions, or holistic operations).
   - Any hints about state shape (simple accumulator vs enriched state like (sum,count)).
4. Output:
   - A concise table or structured list of 15–30 examples, grouped by type (simple aggregates, window-like, business metrics, etc.).
   - A short summary of patterns that recur across multiple services or posts.
