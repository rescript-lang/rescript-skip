You are a deep research assistant.
Assume you have access to the outputs of several prior tasks (Skip examples, streaming/windowed analytics, FRP/UI, incremental DB/graph examples).
Goal: synthesize a high-level expressivity coverage matrix for a Skip-style reactive calculus.

1. Group all collected examples into families:
   - Simple per-key aggregates (sum, count, avg, min/max),
   - Enriched-state aggregates (average with (sum,count), histograms, multi-field metrics),
   - Windowed/session-based aggregates,
   - Graph/relational aggregates,
   - Business metrics and UI/state patterns.
2. For each family, estimate:
   - Fraction of examples that are naturally expressible as well-formed per-key reducers with plausible inverse operations (possibly with richer state).
   - Fraction that are expressible only as partial reducers with fallback-to-recompute.
   - Fraction that require different combinators altogether (for example, window operators or holistic algorithms).
3. Output:
   - A concise matrix or table showing these families and coverage estimates.
   - 3–5 key observations about where a reactive calculus for Skip should focus:
     - Which reducer patterns to prioritize as well-formed by construction,
     - Which patterns to explicitly leave as partial/fallback,
     - Which areas suggest the need for new combinators beyond reducers.
