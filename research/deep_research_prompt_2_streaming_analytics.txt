You are a deep research assistant.
Goal: collect realistic streaming and windowed aggregation examples from popular systems, to use as targets for Skip’s expressivity.

1. Focus on:
   - Apache Flink (especially Table/SQL UDAF examples),
   - Kafka Streams (KTable aggregations),
   - Microsoft Trill,
   - Apache Beam and Spark Streaming,
   - Materialize (streaming SQL).
2. For each system, look at official docs, tutorials, and blog posts showing:
   - Sliding-window, tumbling-window, session-window aggregations.
   - Per-key metrics, running totals, averages, min/max, histograms, top-K, approximate distinct, and time-based summaries.
3. For each distinct example pattern, record:
   - System plus link to the example.
   - Informal description of the aggregation (what it computes).
   - Whether it uses explicit add/remove/inverse logic, or only append-style updates.
   - Whether the aggregation could in principle be expressed as:
     - a per-key multiset fold with an invertible accumulator, or
     - something that inherently depends on windows/order/holistic properties.
4. Output:
   - A grouped list of about 20–40 patterns, with a 1–2 sentence description each.
   - A brief note for each pattern on whether it looks compatible with a Skip-style well-formed reducer with enriched state, or clearly outside that model.
