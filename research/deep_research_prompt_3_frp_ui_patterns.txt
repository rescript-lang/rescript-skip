You are a deep research assistant.
Goal: find FRP and reactive UI patterns that involve aggregations or maintained summaries, to see which should be expressible via Skip-style collections and reducers.

1. Look at:
   - Classic FRP libraries (Fran, Yampa, Reactive Banana),
   - Elm and Elm-inspired architectures,
   - React / Redux and modern UI frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid) where state is maintained via reducers or accumulators.
2. Collect examples where state is:
   - A running total or counter,
   - A rolling window or recent history,
   - A derived summary over collections (for example, cart totals, unread counts, filtered lists with counts),
   - Any undo/redo, time-travel, or event-log-backed summaries.
3. For each example, record:
   - Source (library, blog/tutorial link, section).
   - What is being aggregated, at what granularity (per user, per UI component, global).
   - Whether the aggregation semantically looks like a multiset function with a plausible inverse, or something that relies on ordering/time.
4. Output:
   - A list of about 15–25 FRP/UI examples, each with:
     - a 1–2 sentence description, and
     - a quick judgement: “natural fit for Skip collection+reducer”, “needs windows/time”, or “better modeled as a state machine, not a reducer”.
