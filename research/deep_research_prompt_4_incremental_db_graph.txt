Goal: identify incremental view maintenance and incremental graph examples that use inverse operations or algebraic structure, to test whether a Skip-style reducer calculus can cover them.

1. Use these as starting points:
   - Incremental view maintenance: DBToaster, F-IVM, Dynamic Yannakakis, classic view-maintenance literature.
   - Incremental graph processing: Yin et al. (GraphBolt) and systems like Ingress.
2. Extract example queries or algorithms where:
   - Inverses or delta operators are crucial for performance.
   - Aggregations over edges/vertices are maintained incrementally (degrees, triangle counts, reachability summaries, etc.).
3. For each example, record:
   - Source (paper, system docs) and a short description.
   - The core aggregation or view being maintained.
   - Whether the update behavior could be seen as:
     - a per-key multiset reducer with some enriched state, or
     - something inherently graph-structural that does not fit a simple collection+reducer shape.
4. Output:
   - A curated list of about 10–20 examples, with emphasis on ones that might be expressible in Skip if we design the right reducer/state patterns.
   - A short summary of which examples look like realistic stretch-goals for Skip’s expressivity versus clear non-goals.
